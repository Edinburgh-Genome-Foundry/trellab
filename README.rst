Trellab
=======

Trellab is a thin layer on top of py-trello that makes it easier to navigate
through the projects of a given organization.

Assume that you have an organization on trello with id ``myorganization`` and
you want to add a card "Task 1" to the list "DONE TASKS" of board "PROJECT 1".

First create a file ``secrets.yaml`` with the credentials obtained on the
Trello app-key page (https://trello.com/app-key):

.. code:: yaml

    api_key: b3bdcf43ad6e96993ab894be2784dad3
    api_secret: 7f35610c2707d32072c712911f8f24cd9ba3b1f730a5b8e6a5
    token: 0b61529eace7f7e46c228e59af73120b554cc904ae5d0cea6d0cd0c
    organization_id: myorganization

Then run the following Python code:

.. code:: python

    from trellab import TrellabOrganizationClient
    client = TrellabOrganizationClient.from_yaml('secrets.yaml')
    boards = client.boards_dict()
    project_1_board = boards.PROJECT_1
    project_1_lists = board.lists_dict()
    project_1_lists.DONE_TASKS.add_card(name="task 1")
